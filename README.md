- 👋 Hi, I’m @SFSU-mkaur10
- 👀 I’m interested in being part of Github community. I had an account while I was in school. I should have listened to my Professor who suggested making these accounts with your personal ID, not your schoo ID. you will not have access to your school id once you graduate. 
- 🌱 I’m currently being trained at the Joanns store as an incoming team member and how to keep shrinkage in the store to a minimum. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing projects. I am good at writing reports. Any kind of detailed or succinct documents. 
- 📫 How to reach me email me @manpreetmahal@ymail.com. May your code works.
